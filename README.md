# Conway's Game of Life implementation

## Description

Conway's Game of Life implementation I tried to do some time ago. It is in working state, but may need some some QoL changes. Might return to finish it sometime.

## Features

- modifiable grid dimensions
- modifiable refresh time
- (non)blocking grid edges

## Technical limitations

- tested only on Linux with readline

## Todo

- comments
- a way to import grid from file
